### This repo includes the following files:

* This README
* `CODEBOOK.md`, a code book for the source and tidied data set
* Data from the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
* These data are tidied by the `runAnalysis()` function (and its helper functions) in `run_analysis.R` and it creates two data sets.
* The two data sets, the contents of which are described in `CODEBOOK.md`: `tidy_dataset.txt` and `computed_means.txt`.
